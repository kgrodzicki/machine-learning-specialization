The 1st early stopping condition, **max_depth**, was implemented in the previous assigment and you will not need to reimplement this.  In addition to these early stopping conditions, the typical stopping conditions of having no mistakes or no more features to split on (which we denote by \"stopping conditions\" 1 and 2) are also included as in the previous assignment.\n",
